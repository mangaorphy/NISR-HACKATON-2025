# ðŸ”® Predictive Analytics Dashboard Guide

## Overview

Your Rwanda Export Strategy Dashboard now includes **ML-powered predictive analytics** that forecast export demand for 2023-2025 across all partner countries!

## ðŸŽ¯ What's New

### Predictive Forecasts Page
A dedicated page showing:
- **Top 15 forecasted markets** for 2025
- **High-confidence growth opportunities** (>70% confidence, >20% growth)
- **Emerging market opportunities** (currently small, but high growth potential)
- **Strategic tier classifications** (A/B/C priority levels)
- **Interactive visualizations** with growth matrices and confidence scores

### Machine Learning Models
- **Linear Regression**: Captures consistent growth trends
- **Polynomial Regression**: Detects non-linear patterns
- **Ensemble Averaging**: Combines both models for robust predictions

## ðŸ“Š How to Access Predictions

### Step 1: Generate Forecast Data (In Notebook)

Run the predictive modeling cells in `import_export.ipynb`:

1. **Cell 17** (after WITS data loading): Load WITS historical data
2. **Cell 19**: Run country-specific demand forecasting
3. **Cell 21**: Generate predictive analytics dashboard
4. **Cell 22**: View strategic market prioritization

### Step 2: Export Insights with Predictions

Run the export cell **(Cell 36)**:

```python
extractor, json_file, csv_files = create_insights_export(
    commodities_df=commodities_df,
    opportunity_analysis=opportunity_analysis,
    quarterly_data=total_by_quarter,
    tier1_markets=tier1_markets,
    tier2_markets=tier2_markets,
    tier3_markets=tier3_markets,
    forecast_df=forecast_df  # ðŸ”® Predictions included!
)
```

This will:
âœ… Extract all insights including predictions  
âœ… Create `export_insights.json` with forecast data  
âœ… Generate CSV files: `export_insights_forecast_*.csv`

### Step 3: Launch Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard_app.py
```

### Step 4: Navigate to Predictions

In the dashboard sidebar, select:
**ðŸ”® Predictive Forecasts**

- **Assess market risks** via volatility and confidence metrics

## ðŸ“‹ Export Recommendations by Tier

### ðŸ”´ Tier A - Immediate Actions (6 months)
- Focus 60% of resources
- Establish direct partnerships
- Increase production capacity
- Launch targeted campaigns

### ðŸŸ¡ Tier B - Medium-term (6-18 months)
- Develop market entry plans
- Build local partnerships
- Conduct feasibility studies
- Participate in trade shows

### ðŸŸ¢ Tier C - Long-term (18+ months)
- Monitor quarterly developments
- Initial distributor contact
- Feasibility assessments
- Prepare for future entry

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "No predictive forecasts available"
**Solution**: Run the forecast cells (19-22) in the notebook first, then re-run the export cell (36)

### Predictions not showing in dashboard
**Solution**: 
1. Check `export_insights.json` contains "predictions" key
2. Restart Streamlit: `Ctrl+C` then `streamlit run dashboard_app.py`
3. Clear Streamlit cache: Click menu â†’ Clear cache

### Low confidence scores
**Interpretation**: 
- <50% confidence = Need more historical data
- 50-70% confidence = Moderate reliability
- >70% confidence = High reliability

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

```
ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGIC MARKET PRIORITIZATION
======================================================================

ðŸ”´ TIER A - PRIORITY MARKETS (Immediate Focus):
   Criteria: >$50M forecast, >20% growth, >70% confidence
   Count: 8 markets

   ðŸŒŸ United Arab Emirates
      â€¢ 2025 Forecast: $524.3M
      â€¢ Growth: +45.2%
      â€¢ CAGR: 13.2%
      â€¢ Confidence: 85%
      â€¢ Action: Scale existing operations, increase marketing spend
```

## ðŸŽ“ Understanding the Models

### Linear Regression (RÂ² Score)
- Measures how well the model fits historical trends
- RÂ² > 0.7 = Strong predictive power
- RÂ² < 0.5 = High uncertainty

### Polynomial Regression
- Captures acceleration/deceleration patterns
- Better for markets with non-linear growth
- Degree 2 polynomial used for balance

### Ensemble Approach
- Averages both models for robustness
- Reduces individual model biases
- Provides more stable predictions

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Sort by confidence** to find most reliable predictions
2. **Cross-reference with strategic markets** for validation
3. **Check volatility** - high volatility = higher risk
4. **Use CAGR** for long-term planning
5. **Download CSVs** for offline analysis in Excel

## ðŸ“ž Support

For questions or issues:
- **Technical**: Check notebook execution order
- **Data**: Verify WITS data is loaded correctly
- **Dashboard**: Ensure Streamlit is up to date (`pip install -U streamlit`)
