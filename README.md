#### Feature Engineering:
```python
# Key Features for ML Models
features = {
    'economic_indicators': ['gdp_growth', 'inflation_rate', 'exchange_rate'],
    'trade_metrics': ['export_volume', 'import_volume', 'trade_balance'],
    'market_factors': ['global_demand', 'competition_index', 'price_volatility'],
    'infrastructure': ['logistics_index', 'ease_of_business', 'connectivity'],
    'policy_environment': ['trade_agreements', 'tariff_rates', 'export_incentives']
}
```
